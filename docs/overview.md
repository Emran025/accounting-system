# Project Overview

## High-Level Summary
The **Supermarket Management System** is a professional, full-stack web application designed to streamline the operations of a modern retail environment. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for managing inventory, tracking sales, recording purchases, and maintaining a robust database of products and categories. The system is built with a focus on speed, reliability, and ease of use, ensuring that supermarket staff can perform daily tasks efficiently.

## The Problem It Solves
Traditional retail management often suffers from:
- **Inaccurate Stock Tracking**: Difficulty in maintaining real-time inventory levels.
- **Pricing Errors**: Inconsistency between purchase costs and selling prices.
- **Manual Record Keeping**: High risk of human error when recording sales and purchases manually.
- **Lack of Insights**: Difficulty in reviewing past invoices and purchase history for business decisions.

This system automates these processes, providing a centralized platform for real-time inventory updates, automated price adjustments based on profit margins, and detailed historical tracking.

## Target Users
- **Supermarket Owners**: To monitor stock levels, sales performance, and purchase history.
- **Inventory Managers**: To track product categories, manage supplier deliveries (purchases), and monitor stock alerts.
- **Cashiers**: To process customer sales efficiently through an intuitive interface.
- **System Administrators**: To manage user access and system configuration.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Inventory Management**: Real-time stock updates as sales are made and purchases are received.
- **Automated Pricing Logic**: Automatically calculates selling prices based on the last purchase price and a predefined minimum profit margin.
- **Multi-Unit Support**: Handles products in both main units (e.g., Cartons) and sub-units (e.g., Pieces).
- **Invoice History**: Detailed record-keeping of all sales and purchases with the ability to review and manage past transactions.
- **Secure Authentication**: Robust login system with session management and brute-force protection.
