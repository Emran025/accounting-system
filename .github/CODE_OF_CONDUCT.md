# Code of Conduct -- ACCSYSTEM ERP

## 1. Purpose

This Code of Conduct establishes the behavioural standards expected of every person who participates in the ACCSYSTEM ERP project, whether as a contributor, maintainer, reviewer, or community member. It exists to ensure that participation in this project is a productive and respectful experience for everyone, regardless of background, identity, or level of experience.

---

## 2. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including but not limited to:

- The GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions, code reviews, wiki).
- Any communication channels associated with the project (email, chat platforms, forums).
- Public events or presentations where an individual represents the project.

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project community in public spaces, such as using an official project email address or acting as an appointed representative.

---

## 3. Standards of Expected Behaviour

All participants are expected to:

- **Treat others with respect.** Address disagreements with professionalism. Critique ideas, not people.
- **Communicate constructively.** Provide actionable, specific feedback in code reviews and discussions. Explain the reasoning behind your position.
- **Assume good intent.** When a message or action could be interpreted multiple ways, choose the most charitable interpretation before responding.
- **Accept responsibility.** If you make an error, acknowledge it, correct it, and move forward. If your actions have negatively affected another participant, offer a sincere apology.
- **Respect differing perspectives.** Contributors come from varied professional and cultural backgrounds. Differences in opinion, approach, and experience are valuable to the project.
- **Prioritise the community.** Decisions should account for the long-term health of the project and its user base, not solely individual preferences.

---

## 4. Unacceptable Behaviour

The following behaviours are prohibited:

- **Harassment.** This includes offensive comments related to gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality. It also includes deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption of discussions, and unwelcome sexual attention.
- **Personal attacks.** Insults, derogatory comments, or ad hominem arguments directed at individuals rather than their contributions.
- **Trolling.** Deliberately provocative, off-topic, or inflammatory remarks intended to derail productive conversation.
- **Doxxing.** Publishing another person's private information (physical address, email address, phone number, employer) without their explicit, documented consent.
- **Sexualised language or imagery.** In any project space, regardless of context.
- **Abuse of authority.** Maintainers must not use their position to silence, punish, or retaliate against contributors who raise legitimate concerns.

## 5. Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for:

- Clarifying the standards described in this document when questions arise.
- Taking appropriate, measured, and fair corrective action in response to behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct.
- Removing, editing, or rejecting comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.
- Communicating the reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

Enforcement decisions should be proportional to the severity and context of the violation.

## 6. Reporting Violations

If you experience or witness behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct, report it to the project maintainer:

**Emran Nasser**
**Email: amrannaser3@gmail.com**

### What to Include in a Report

- Your contact information (so we can follow up with you).
- The names or identifiers of the individuals involved.
- A description of the behaviour you are reporting, including dates, times, and locations (e.g., the URL of the relevant issue, pull request, or comment).
- Any supporting evidence (screenshots, links, email threads).
- Whether you have already attempted to address the situation directly, and if so, what the outcome was.

### Confidentiality

All reports will be handled with discretion. The identity of the reporter will not be disclosed to the accused party or to the general community without the reporter's explicit consent, except where required by law.

---

## 7. Enforcement Process

The following graduated response framework will be applied. The appropriate level depends on the severity of the violation, the context, and whether the individual has prior incidents.

### Level 1 -- Correction

- **Trigger:** A single instance of using inappropriate language or engaging in behaviour deemed unprofessional.
- **Response:** A private, written message from a project maintainer explaining the violation and why the behaviour was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.
- **Duration:** No restricted participation period.

### Level 2 -- Formal Warning

- **Trigger:** A violation through a single serious incident, or a pattern of minor incidents after a Level 1 correction.
- **Response:** A formal warning with clearly stated consequences for continued behaviour. The individual must refrain from interacting with the affected parties for a specified period, including in external channels.
- **Duration:** Minimum 30 days of restricted interaction.

### Level 3 -- Temporary Suspension

- **Trigger:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour or a single incident of significant harm.
- **Response:** A temporary suspension from all participation in the project (issues, pull requests, discussions, code reviews). The duration will be commensurate with the severity.
- **Duration:** Minimum 90 days.

### Level 4 -- Permanent Exclusion

- **Trigger:** A demonstrated pattern of violation, sustained harassment, or a single incident of extreme severity (threats, doxxing, discrimination).
- **Response:** Permanent removal from all project spaces. No further contributions will be accepted.
