        ## Performance Issue Report

        Use this template to report **measurable** performance problems. If the system is functionally broken (producing incorrect results), use the **Bug Report** template instead.

        Example:
        The GET /api/reports/trial-balance endpoint takes approximately 12 seconds
        to respond when the general_ledger table contains 100,000+ entries. The
        expected response time for this endpoint is under 2 seconds.

        - Endpoint: GET /api/reports/trial-balance
        - Response time: 12.3 seconds (average of 5 requests)
        - Slowest query: SELECT ... FROM general_ledger ... (8.7 seconds)
